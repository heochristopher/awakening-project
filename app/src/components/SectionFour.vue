          <span class="type">Composition:</span> the painting's focus on Leonce
          and the wilderness suggests a sense of adventure and self-discovery.
          The disheveled appearance of the protagonist could be interpreted as
          representing the challenges and hardships he is facing as he embarks
          on this journey. The use of an impressionist style, with its emphasis
          on loose, expressive brushstrokes and vibrant, atmospheric color, adds
          to the sense of emotion and movement in the painting.
          <br /><br /><span class="type">Style:</span> the bright greens and
          reds used in the wilderness scene suggest a sense of excitement and
          possibility, while the muted, monochromatic tones used to depict
          Leonce's disheveled appearance convey a sense of weariness and strain.
          <br /><br /><span class="type">Interpretation:</span>
          the painting evokes a sense of adventure and self-discovery, and
          suggests that even in the midst of hardship and loss, individuals can
          find the strength and resilience to pursue their own path and explore
          their own identity. This painting could be considered Impressionist
          due to its focus on capturing the fleeting, atmospheric qualities of
          light and color.
